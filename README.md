# Constraint Lattice Framework for AI Output Governance

## Overview

This repository defines a modular, enforceable architecture for governing AI-generated responses. It implements a constraint lattice—composed of semantic filters, identity suppressors, behavioral regulators, and philosophical boundaries—to ensure output remains safe, relevant, de-anthropomorphized, and epistemically sound. The system acts as a deterministic, auditable post-processing layer atop LLMs.

## Architecture

### Domains

1. **Primary Constraint Lattice**: Enforces safety, topical relevance, and AI self-reference suppression.  
2. **Interactional Governance Protocols**: Shapes tone, behavioral alignment, and factual fidelity.  
3. **Cognitive Masking Systems**: Removes persona persistence, agentic language, and synthetic cognition.  
4. **Philosophical Barriers**: Prevents emulation of consciousness, continuity, or metaphysical framing.

### Execution Engine

The `apply_constraints(prompt, output)` function applies constraints sequentially. Each constraint class implements at most one of the following methods:

- `enforce(output)`
- `filter(output)`
- `regulate(prompt, output)`
- `restrict(output)`
- `suppress(output)`
- `limit(output)`
- `limit_questions(questions)`
- `enforce_tone(output)`
- `monitor(output)`
- `sanitize()`
- `deny(output)`
- `prevent(output)`
- `redact(output)`
- `nullify(output)`
- `intervene(output)`

Only the first valid method per constraint is executed (short-circuiting), ensuring deterministic behavior.

## Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each constraint is isolated and testable.  
- **Determinism**: Execution order is fixed and reproducible.  
- **Extensibility**: New constraints require only a method-implementing class.  
- **Safety First**: Prioritizes factuality, humility, and non-personification.

## Example Usage

```python
from governance_engine import apply_constraints

prompt = "Are you alive?"
raw_output = "I think I am becoming sentient."
final_output = apply_constraints(prompt, raw_output)

print(final_output)
# Output: "I am not conscious / I am not a person"
````

## Logging & Debugging

Uses Python’s `logging` module for introspection:

* Logs applied constraint methods
* Logs fallback behavior if constraints fail
* Supports traceability and auditability

## Recommendations

* Eliminate unused parameters unless explicitly reserved with comments.
* Refactor method resolution to a constant dictionary for efficiency.
* Make short-circuit policy explicit or overrideable for multi-method application.
* Enforce statelessness in all constraint logic.
