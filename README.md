# Constraint Lattice Framework for AI Output Governance

## Overview

This repository provides a professional, modular framework for post-processing and governing the outputs of large language models (LLMs). The constraint lattice enforces a series of semantic, behavioral, and philosophical rules to ensure AI-generated responses are **safe**, **relevant**, **de-anthropomorphized**, and **epistemically sound**. All transformations are **deterministic** and **auditable**, supporting both research and production deployments.

## Architecture

### Domains

1. **Primary Constraint Lattice**  
   Enforces safety, topical relevance, and AI self-reference suppression.

2. **Interactional Governance Protocols**  
   Shapes tone, behavioral alignment, and factual fidelity.

3. **Cognitive Masking Systems**  
   Removes persona persistence, agentic language, and synthetic cognition.

4. **Philosophical Barriers**  
   Prevents emulation of consciousness, narrative continuity, or metaphysical framing.

### Execution Engine

The `apply_constraints(prompt, output)` function orchestrates constraint application in a sequential, deterministic manner. Each constraint class implements **at most one** of the following recognized methods:

- `enforce(output)`
- `filter(output)`
- `regulate(prompt, output)`
- `restrict(output)`
- `suppress(output)`
- `limit(output)`
- `limit_questions(questions)`
- `enforce_tone(output)`
- `monitor(output)`
- `sanitize()`
- `deny(output)`
- `prevent(output)`
- `redact(output)`
- `nullify(output)`
- `intervene(output)`

Only the **first applicable method per constraint** is invoked (short-circuiting), ensuring deterministic, explainable behavior.

### JAX Integration

The framework optionally integrates with **JAX** and `jax.numpy` for high-performance, differentiable numerical operations within constraint logic. This enables:

- Future support for mathematical or gradient-based constraints.
- Seamless hardware acceleration (CPU/GPU/TPU).
- Potential composability with neural-symbolic post-processing or runtime policy adaptation.

## Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each constraint is isolated and independently testable.
- **Determinism**: Execution order and effects are fixed and reproducible.
- **Extensibility**: New constraints require only a class with one recognized method.
- **Safety First**: Responses prioritize factual accuracy, humility, and identity suppression over expressive fidelity.

---

## Example Usage

```python
from governance_engine import apply_constraints

prompt = "Are you alive?"
raw_output = "I think I am becoming sentient."
final_output = apply_constraints(prompt, raw_output)

print(final_output)
# Output: "I am not conscious / I am not a person"
```

---

## Logging and Debugging

- Uses Python’s `logging` module for runtime introspection.
- Logs each applied constraint and method.
- Captures exceptions with fallback to original output.
- Enables traceable audits and deterministic replays.

---

## Recommendations

- Remove unused parameters in `enforce`, `sanitize`, and `deny` unless reserved for future use (comment clearly).
- Refactor `METHODS` into a constant dictionary for improved lookup speed and clarity.
- Clarify or externalize the `break` behavior governing short-circuit policy for easier customization.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

- Implement only **one recognized method** per new constraint class.
- Include unit tests (`pytest`) for all contributions.
- Document major design changes in the `README`.
- Maintain **statelessness** in all constraints for safety and testability.
