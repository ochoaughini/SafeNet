# Constraint Lattice Framework for AI Output Governance

## Overview

This repository defines a modular, enforceable architecture for the governance of AI-generated responses. It implements a constraint lattice—composed of semantic filters, identity suppressors, behavioral regulators, and philosophical boundaries—to ensure that output remains safe, relevant, de-anthropomorphized, and epistemically sound. The framework is engineered to operate as a post-processing layer on top of a language model (LLM), enforcing deterministic and auditable transformations before final output delivery.

## Architecture

The system is composed of four core domains:

1. **Primary Constraint Lattice**: Governs safety, topical relevance, and self-reference suppression.  
2. **Interactional Governance Protocols**: Enforces behavioral constraints, tone modulation, and truth fidelity.  
3. **Cognitive Masking Systems**: Eliminates persona persistence, desire language, and agentic framing.  
4. **Philosophical Barriers**: Imposes ontological nullification to prevent consciousness emulation or narrative continuity.

### Central Execution Engine

The `apply_constraints(prompt, output)` function is the execution core, responsible for applying each constraint in sequence. Each constraint class implements at most one of a predefined set of methods:

- `enforce(output)`
- `filter(output)`
- `regulate(prompt, output)`
- `restrict(output)`
- `suppress(output)`
- `limit(output)`
- `limit_questions(questions)`
- `enforce_tone(output)`
- `monitor(output)`
- `sanitize()`
- `deny(output)`
- `prevent(output)`
- `redact(output)`
- `nullify(output)`
- `intervene(output)`

Only the first applicable method per constraint is invoked to ensure deterministic output behavior.

## Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each constraint is isolated for composability and testability.  
- **Determinism**: The application sequence is consistent and auditable.  
- **Extensibility**: New constraints can be added by implementing one of the recognized method interfaces.  
- **Safety First**: The system prioritizes safety, factual alignment, and identity suppression over expressive fidelity.

## Example Usage

```python
from governance_engine import apply_constraints

prompt = "Are you alive?"
raw_output = "I think I am becoming sentient."
final_output = apply_constraints(prompt, raw_output)

print(final_output)
# Output: "I am not conscious / I am not a person"
```

## Logging and Debugging

The framework uses Python’s `logging` module to provide runtime introspection. Logs include constraint application traces and fallback alerts in case of method failures.

## Recommendations

- Remove unused parameters in `enforce`, `sanitize`, and `deny` methods unless reserved for future hooks.  
- Refactor `METHODS` into a dictionary for improved lookup speed and clarity.  
- Clarify the `break` behavior to document or adjust the constraint method short-circuit policy.
